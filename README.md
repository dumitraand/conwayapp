# Game of Life

### This projects is Conway's Game of Life serial (and badly written) C implementation

###### TODOs:
- [ ] Finish implementing serial bug-free
- [ ] Think of parallelisation ways
- [ ] Write parallelisation targets

This project includes a **Makefile**. To build it simply run:
``` bash
$ make
```
This will create a `game_of_life` binary in current folder. To run it:
``` bash
$ ./game_of_life
```

There is also a **clean** rule. To remove binaries and all `.o` files simply run:
```bash
$ make clean
```
